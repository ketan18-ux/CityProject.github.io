Efficiency Analysis – Flood Evacuation Simulation (Problem 10)

Goal:
Simulate how flood spreads through a large city road network using
multi-source BFS, determine flood arrival time for every locality, and
classify shelters as SAFE or UNSAFE.

Definitions:
V = number of localities (20 in provided dataset)
E = number of city roads (20)
S = number of shelters (2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 – Multi-Source BFS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All flood sources are inserted into the BFS queue initially with distance 0.

For every road (u, v):
    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1

This simulates discrete time-steps for flood spreading.

Time Complexity:
    O(V + E)
Space Complexity:
    O(V)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 – Flood Arrival Reporting
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For every node:
    Print dist[node]
Cost:
    O(V)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 – Shelter Safety Analysis
A shelter is UNSAFE if:
    dist[shelter] <= safeThreshold

This requires:
    O(S)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 – Evacuation Priority Sorting
Shelters that flood early are sorted by flood time.

Cost:
    O(S log S)

Since S is very small compared to V, time is negligible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL TIME COMPLEXITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    O(V + E + S log S)
Dominated by:
    O(V + E)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL SPACE COMPLEXITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    O(V + E)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
The algorithm scales linearly with city size and is optimal for
real-time disaster management systems.
